This workflow automatically generates weekly portfolio reports for clients using their investment data from Google Sheets. It calculates profit, growth and other key metrics, formats a professional report, sends it via Gmail and updates the client’s status in the sheet.

## Quick Steps to Start:

1. Prepare your Google Sheet with columns: Client, Email, Invested, Current Value, Status.
2. [Connect your Google Sheets and Gmail accounts in n8n](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).
3. Start the workflow manually.
4. The workflow fetches client data, calculates metrics, generates the AI report, formats it in HTML, sends emails and updates the sheet automatically.

## What It Does

The Weekly Client Report Generator streamlines weekly client communications for investment portfolios. Using client data from Google Sheets, it calculates total investment, profit and growth for each client. The workflow uses AI to generate a concise, professional report including a summary, key highlights, risk analysis and future outlook.

Reports are automatically formatted in HTML for easy readability in emails. The Google Sheet is updated to mark each client’s report as “Sent,” providing a clear tracking system. A wait node is included to ensure smooth processing and act as a safeguard against Gmail sending limits.

By automating these steps, the workflow saves time, reduces manual errors and ensures consistent, high-quality client reporting.
